He says he did not intend to break the window but was aiming at another person. This means he did not intend to damage the window. However, intention is not the only route to liability, as recklessness also suffices. A person who throws a brick in the direction of a group of people near a window, regardless of what they were aiming at, is clearly taking an obvious risk that property would be damaged.

So ZIEGLER commits the offence when he cultivates the cannabis plants. Harvesting, cutting and stripping a cannabis plant is ‘producing’ ( R v Harris [1996] 1 Cr App R 369), so ZIEGLER once again ‘produces’ when he harvests the cannabis plants. The addition of adulterants or bulking agents can amount to the production of a controlled drug ( R v Williams [2011] EWCA Crim 232), so ZIEGLER commits the offence at this point as well. All of this means that answer B is incorrect. Being ‘concerned in the production’ requires evidence that the accused played an identifiable role in the production of the drug in question. This was not satisfied where the accused simply permitted two others who were producing drugs to use his kitchen ( R v Farr [1982] Crim LR 745), which means ARCHER does not commit the offence (answer A is incorrect)."

CRAMPTON is livid and goes back to the fish and chip shop which is now closed. In a fit of temper because he has been given the wrong food, CRAMPTON smashes the front window of the fish and chip shop. He leaves the scene and walks back to his home but is stopped by the police 20 minutes later and is arrested on suspicion of committing criminal damage.

This allowed him to take control of their lives for a number of years and in doing so to direct them to move about the country from location to location. The defendant was eventually arrested and convicted of kidnapping on the basis of the Crown’s case that the offence of kidnapping had occurred, as his victims had made journeys around the country which they had been induced to make as a result of the defendant’s false story. The defendant successfully appealed against the kidnapping conviction, with the court stating that causing a person to move from place to place when unaccompanied by the defendant could not itself constitute either taking or carrying away or deprivation of liberty, which were necessary elements of the offence."

The pair have since argued about who owns what in the house they shared before Kelly moved out three weeks ago. Kelly returns to the house with ORTEGA (her friend) while Amy is at work, with the idea of removing several items of property that Kelly says belong to her. Once inside the house, Kelly becomes upset and says to ORTEGA, ‘I don’t care about taking my things—smash them instead!’ Kelly and ORTEGA cause damage to a TV in the living room of the house. The TV belongs to Kelly and also belongs to Amy as they purchased it jointly (a fact that Kelly is aware of). ORTEGA is unaware of this and believes the TV belongs solely to Kelly and that she wants the TV damaged.\n\nConsidering the offence of criminal damage (under s. 1(1) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971), which of the following comments is correct?",
